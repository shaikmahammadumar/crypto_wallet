# crypto_wallet
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a cryptocurrency wallet using MetaMask, one of the most popular Web3 wallets for blockchain applications. The primary purpose of this project is to explore the integration of MetaMask with decentralized applications (dApps) and provide a simple interface for managing cryptocurrency transactions.

Features: Wallet Connection: Users can easily connect their MetaMask wallet to the application, enabling interaction with Ethereum or other supported blockchain networks. Cryptocurrency Transactions: The project supports sending and receiving cryptocurrencies seamlessly using the MetaMask interface. Account Balance Management: Users can view their wallet balance in real-time, directly fetched from the blockchain. Blockchain Interaction: The project demonstrates how to interact with smart contracts or decentralized services by leveraging MetaMask's Web3 API.

Technologies Used: MetaMask for wallet integration. Web3.js (or another library) for blockchain interaction.

This project serves as a foundation for anyone starting their journey into blockchain development or creating dApps. It demonstrates the essential steps for wallet integration and basic cryptocurrency operations while focusing on simplicity and user experience.
